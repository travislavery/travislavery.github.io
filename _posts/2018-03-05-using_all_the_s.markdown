Of course, the $$$'s that I'm talking about are the shorthand for jQuery, and lets just say they are pretty great. I just finished up my fourth project, jQuery and Rails. At long last, I have made it to the section that I am best at: Javascript. I spent a lot of time prior to beginning this program using javascript and jQuery, so I blasted through these two sections, and knocked out my project super quick. There are so many things that I enjoy about jquery and javascript, and the incredible power of rails being used along side these is just awesome. I can definitely understand now what Avi was talking about in his videos about making a single request to the backend, and just doing everything with ruby though. The most difficult part of this was remembering when I was writing in ruby, and when I was using javascript. 

It was very interesting learning how to create an object and save it to the database on the back end, and then send all of the information about that newly created object up to the front, so that I could re-create it there. Kind of like a teleporter, just beaming all the little pieces and reassembling it on the other side- partially. Seperation of responsibility of the object's role in the back, and then it's responsibilities up front displayed itself by the different kinds of functions and even the attributes you assign in the two different places. Something that occurred to me is that this totally isn't DRY! Of course, given the limitations of how to communicate information over the internet, its as dry as it can get, so ah well. 

Restructuring my old project to make use of jQuery and javascript turned out to be quite the undertaking, and the sheer quantity of code I had previous written and that I had to just delete because it was no longer needed brough me great sadness. I also have this foreboding feeling that quite a bit of being a programmer is going back through your own hard-won code, and then just deleting it, re-writing it in a new and better way, and repeat. Guess I'll see not to long from now, eh? 

I am almost finished with the program. I am going to do it, I'm going to finish before the end of my 3rd month. I'm going to get my life back, being as for the last 2 1/2 months I've gone to work for 8 hours, came home, and then programmed until my brain was fried. Whatever will I do with my free time? Lets not kid ourselves, there is no way I am done learning about programming in my free time. Perhaps I'll learn elixer?
